# 34.-StayInn
This is Project StayInn, our prototype Hotel Booking Website, with hotel data provided by [Ascenda](https://www.ascenda.com/) (they provided it in the form of API calls, they likely
removed public access to it immediately after the project). Done as part of SUTD's Elements of Software Construction (ESC) module's requirements.
